The Bridgefy Software Development Kit (SDK) is a state-of-the-art, plug-and-play package that will let people use your mobile app when they don’t have access to the Internet, by using Bluetooth mesh networks.

Integrate the Bridgefy SDK into your Android and iOS app to reach the 3.5 billion people that don’t always have access to an Internet connection, and watch engagement and revenue grow!

## Operation mode

All the connections are handled seamlessly by the SDK to create a mesh network. The size of this
network depends on the number of devices connected and the environment as a variable factor,
allowing you to join nodes in the same network or nodes in different networks.

## Platform permissions

To utilize this SDK in a Flutter application, you'll need to configure permissions for each
individual platform (iOS and Android) first. You can read more about each platform's requirements
